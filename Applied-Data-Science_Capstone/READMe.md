# :rocket: Applied Data Science Capstone
This capstone project is in [Course 10: Applied Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone?specialization=ibm-data-science).
## :page_facing_up: Project Overview
In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

### Part 1: Data Collection
The result file is [Data collection with API.ipynb](Applied-Data-Science_Capstone/1_Data_collection_api.ipynb).

### Part 2: Create Dashboard using Plotly and Dash
The result file is [Part2.py](Assignment4/DV0101EN-Final-Assign-Part-2-Questions.py).
### Objective:
The objective of this part of the Fnal assignment is to create dashboards to contain your plots and charts and to provide the directors with the ability to select a particular report or a period of time so they can discuss the data in detail.

In this lab you will create dashboards using Dash and Plotly and then add user-interactions to your dashboards.

### Creating dashboards and adding customizations to the dashboards
The directors of XYZAutomobiles have requested a dashboard to be developed so they can drill into the data in more detail for specific years or by different categories. Your second task is to create a suitable dashboard and add in user interactions so that the directors can select the data they want to review without the need to request new plots.
