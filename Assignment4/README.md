# :rocket: Assignment 4: Data Visualization with Python
The final peer review assignments are in [Course 8: Data Visualization with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-data-visualization?specialization=ibm-data-science).
## :page_facing_up: Project Overview
### Analyzing the Impact of Recession on Automobile Sales
You have been hired by XYZAutomotives as a data scientist. Your first task is to analyze the historical data and give the company directors insights on how the sales were affected during times of recession. You will provide a number of charts/plots to visualize the data and make it easy for the directors to understand your analysis.

### Part 1: Create visualizations using Matplotib, Seaborn & Folium
The result file is [Part1.ipynb](Assignment4/DV0101EN-Final-Assign-Part1.ipynb).
#### Objective:
The objective of this part of the Final Assignment is to analyze the historical trends in automobile sales during recession periods. The goal is to provide insights into how the sales of XYZAutomotives, a company specializing in automotive sales, were affected during times of recession.

In this lab you will create visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas.

### Part 2: Create Dashboard using Plotly and Dash
The result file is [Part2.py](Assignment4/DV0101EN-Final-Assign-Part-2-Questions.py).
### Objective:
The objective of this part of the Fnal assignment is to create dashboards to contain your plots and charts and to provide the directors with the ability to select a particular report or a period of time so they can discuss the data in detail.

In this lab you will create dashboards using Dash and Plotly and then add user-interactions to your dashboards.

### Creating dashboards and adding customizations to the dashboards
The directors of XYZAutomobiles have requested a dashboard to be developed so they can drill into the data in more detail for specific years or by different categories. Your second task is to create a suitable dashboard and add in user interactions so that the directors can select the data they want to review without the need to request new plots.
